## Introduction

The Image Gallery Project is a single-page website that displays a collection of images along with their captions. It uses a grid layout to arrange the images in a responsive and visually appealing manner.

## Website Structure

The website consists of the following sections:

- Main Header Section: The header contains the title "My Gallery" displayed in a large font size and centered on the page.

- Image Gallery Section: The main content of the website is the image gallery section. It uses a grid layout to display the images and captions. Each image is represented by a card with a grayscale filter, and when hovered over, the image is displayed in full color with a drop shadow. The captions appear at the bottom of each card and have a transparent background with a gradient effect.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
